# JavaScript Practical Exercises

## 1.1 An Introduction to JavaScript

3. Prints your name and age to the console.

---

## 1.2 Manuals and Specifications

This chapter is mostly about learning how to use documentation.

### Exercise 2 — Documentation Challenge

Without asking ChatGPT, use MDN or JavaScript.info to find:

1. How to round a number.
2. How to convert a string to lowercase.
3. How to check whether an array contains a value.
4. How to get the length of a string.

Then write a small program using all four.

---

## 1.3 The Modern Mode — `"use strict"`

### Exercise 3 — Strict Mode

Create:

```js
"use strict";
```

Then deliberately make these mistakes:

```js
x = 10;
```

and

```js
function test() {
  y = 20;
}
```

Observe what happens.

Then fix the code by properly declaring the variables.

---

## 1.4 Developer Console

### Exercise 4 — Console Playground

Use the browser console to experiment with:

```js
console.log();
console.error();
console.warn();
```

Print:

```text
Your name
Your age
Your favorite programming language
5 + 10
"Hello" + " World"
```

---

# 2.1 Hello, World!

### Exercise 5 — Browser Interaction

Create a page that:

1. Uses `alert()` to welcome the user.
2. Uses `prompt()` to ask for their name.
3. Uses `confirm()` to ask:
   `"Do you want to continue?"`
4. Displays the results in the console.

---

# 2.2 Code Structure

### Exercise 6 — Fix the Code

Fix this code:

```js
let name = "Ayan"

console.log(name)

if (name === "Ayan") {
    console.log("Welcome")
```

Make it valid JavaScript and properly structured.

### Exercise 7

Write a program containing:

- variables
- `if`
- function
- comments
- multiple statements

Organize it with proper indentation.

---

# 2.3 The Modern Mode — `"use strict"`

### Exercise 8 — Strict vs Non-Strict

Run this once without strict mode:

```js
x = 100;
console.log(x);
```

```js
"use strict";

x = 100;
console.log(x);
```

Explain the difference in your own words.
